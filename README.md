# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? DriverPass offers an improved solution for student drivers preparing for their theoretical driving exams and arranging practical driving test practice sessions. DriverPass envisioned the development of a website where users can register, buy study packages, access online study materials and exams, as well as book appointments with instructors for practice sessions. Additionally, DriverPass staff members should have the capability to purchase packages on behalf of customers and manage their appointment scheduling.
What did you do particularly well? I found that the diagrams in project 2 were straightforward and effectively conveyed visual representations of essential application concepts.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? In retrospect, I believe that I could have delved deeper into the assumptions and limitations within the Business Requirements Document from project 1. I would expand the document to encompass several additional assumptions and limitations.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I believe that I successfully grasped the user's requirements through a combination of technical requirements analysis and interviews. I used this information to construct use cases and corresponding diagrams, which served as a valuable tool for visualizing the user's needs. Subsequently, I adapted these needs to align with the technical possibilities for a website. Given that the users are the primary audience and frequent users of the site, it was imperative to keep their requirements at the forefront of the design process.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? Considering both functional and non-functional requirements proved to be extremely beneficial in the realm of software design. Additionally, I found that crafting use case, UML, and Gantt diagrams played a pivotal role in enhancing visualization and facilitating a clearer comprehension of the intended functionalities of the application for both myself and others.
